# Idea 8014059: Make call syntax simpler for statically resolved member constraints #

The idea is basically explained by the following code:
// this works as expected
type Example() =
member __.F(i) = printfn "%d" i
let inline f (x : ^a) =
(^a : (member F : int -> unit) (x, 1))
(^a : (member F : int -> unit) (x, 2))
f (Example())
// this doesn't work
let inline f (x : ^a when ^a : (member F : int -> unit)) =
// the compiler knows that there must be member F and its signature
// so the following should be possible
x.F(1)
x.F(2)

Oh yes, much more readable!
I have incorporated your suggestion in my suggestion for "Interfaces as simple, reusable and named sets of member constraints on statically resolved type parameters": http://fslang.uservoice.com/forums/245727-f-language/suggestions/8393964-interfaces-as-simple-reusable-and-named-sets-of-m

I think this is totally reasonable, marking it as approved-in-principle.
Note also that a naked type alias can imply multiple constraints, giving a way to name collections of constraints
