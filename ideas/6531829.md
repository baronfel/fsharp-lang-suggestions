# Idea 6531829: Allow TypeProviders to supply location with errors

When a custom type provider fails, the type provider will typically throw, there is not much else to do.
I suggest to add the ability to add an error location when something fails. This would allow to pinpoint with squigglies where the error is in ie json/sql/whatever.
Perhaps the simplest non-breaking implementation would be to add a known exception type that contains a file location and a range. So the TP still just throws, but adds this information where possible.

See also this proposal https://fslang.uservoice.com/forums/245727-f-language/suggestions/5663288-allow-type-providers-to-report-warnings-to-the-com, these should probably be combined
