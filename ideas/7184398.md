# Idea 7184398: Cartesian product function for collections

It's often useful to compute the Cartesian product (cross join) of two collections. I always end up writing something like this:
let cross xs ys =
seq {
for x in xs do
for y in ys ->
x, y
}
I think it would be useful to have this in the standard collection modules.

The FSharp.Core 4.0.0.0 ship has sailed. It seems reasonable for FSharp.Core vNext, though I'd like to see more input on this., e.g. do other languages have this in core functional collection libraries, ,what naming do they use etc.?

Python calls it "product". https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.product
