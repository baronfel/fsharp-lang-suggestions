This would enable scenarios where the type provider can rewrite, or abstract at compile time F# code and emit new one.
It could replace a macro system without the need for new syntax or tooling.

It could be used by transpilers to check validity and emit code at design/compile time

Hi @thinkb4coding
I would very much be in favour of this feature for F# vNext.

Just to note that this would almost certainly require this to have been fully implemented: [/ideas/suggestion-5675977-allow-type-providers-to-generate-types-from-other](/ideas/suggestion-5675977-allow-type-providers-to-generate-types-from-other.md)
