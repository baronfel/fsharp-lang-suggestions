# Idea 7017131: Make F# union types like "list" that have no subtypes 'sealed'

The compiled form of the "list" type in F# uses a single class. This is also the case for some other F# union types, e.g. ones which are enumerations where no case carries any data. For these types, the compiled representation of the union type should be marked "sealed" in F# metadata
This is a breaking change w.r.t. hypothetical clients in other .NET languages that take advantage of this, though we know of no such instance in practice.
