Lenses and prisms provide principled support for functional getters and setters. There is a decent amount of machinery that goes into creating them, and that machinery could be added into the language. I am not offering up a recommendation yet, but would love to see some research into how this could be done and F# seems like the language that could really innovate in this space.

See comment â€“ a more detailed design proposal is needed to progress this

This is a good research area. However it feels like it should be closed until a more concrete design proposal is available. Otherwise people don't quite know what they are voting on :)
