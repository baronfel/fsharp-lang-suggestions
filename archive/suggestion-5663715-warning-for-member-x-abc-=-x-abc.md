In F#, it can happen that renaming and replacing identifiers gives rise to the non-sensical
member x.ABC = x.ABC
While this is a special case, it is very obviously an error. It may be worth special-casing a warning for this.

Declining, no one has voted for this, this belongs in tools like FSharpLint.
