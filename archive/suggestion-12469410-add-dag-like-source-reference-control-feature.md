F# has source reference limitation feature by source order, but it should be enhanced.
I think source references should be like DAG.
Now upper source code can be referenced by any lower source code, but I wanna control some group can and some not.
This may be enough if module has access control feature like C++'s friend against module.
This feature increase limitations but eliminates complex source relationship and make easier to grab source structure if it's used properly.

It's completely different thing.

This increse limitation.
