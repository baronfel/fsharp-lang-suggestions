It would be helpful to have type annotation made of the type of another expression:
let a = 1
let b : typeofexpr<a> = 2
this type of type annotation exists in Oracle SQL database (tablename.column_name%type) and is implemented in jai language:

I believe it is also possible to do similar thing with C++ templates.
